# 🗳️ Transparent Election Funding System

Welcome to a decentralized solution for transparent election campaign funding! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity, this project ensures that all campaign donations are transparent, verifiable, and immutable, addressing issues of accountability in political funding.

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 Register and verify political candidates
- 💸 Accept donations with strict compliance checks
- 🔍 Publicly query donation records
- 🚫 Prevent illegal or anonymous donations
- ⏰ Immutable timestamped audit trail
- 🔐 Secure fund withdrawal by candidates
- 📊 Track total funds per candidate
- 🛡️ Enforce donation limits and regulations

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Candidates**
- Register as a candidate with verified identity
- Set up a campaign wallet to receive donations
- Withdraw funds securely to authorized accounts
- Provide transparency reports via public queries

**For Donors**
- Submit donations with KYC-verified identity
- Ensure donations comply with legal limits
- Receive a receipt with a unique transaction ID

**For Regulators/Public**
- Query donation records by candidate or donor
- Verify compliance with funding regulations
- Audit the immutable transaction history

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Deploy Contracts**
   - Deploy all contracts on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity.
   - Ensure `CandidateRegistry` and `DonorRegistry` are initialized first.

2. **Register Candidates**
   - Candidates call `register-candidate` in `CandidateRegistry` with their details.
   - Verification process (off-chain KYC) approves candidates.

3. **Accept Donations**
   - Donors submit funds via `DonationProcessor`, which checks compliance using `ComplianceChecker`.
   - Funds are stored in `FundVault` under the candidate's campaign.

4. **Audit and Verify**
   - Use `AuditTrail` and `TransparencyDashboard` to query donation records.
   - Regulators can verify compliance via public functions.

5. **Withdraw Funds**
   - Candidates withdraw funds from `FundVault` using secure multi-signature authentication.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Frontend (Optional)**: React for a user-friendly dashboard
- **Off-Chain**: KYC verification service for candidates and donors

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- All contracts use Clarity’s type safety and immutability.
- Multi-signature withdrawals prevent unauthorized access.
- Compliance checks ensure adherence to legal regulations.
- Immutable audit trail guarantees transparency.

## 📜 Example Workflow
1. A candidate registers via `CandidateRegistry`.
2. A donor submits $500 via `DonationProcessor`.
3. `ComplianceChecker` verifies the donation is within legal limits.
4. Funds are stored in `FundVault` and logged in `AuditTrail`.
5. The public queries `TransparencyDashboard` to view the donation.
6. The candidate withdraws funds securely from `FundVault`.

## 🌟 Why This Matters
This system ensures transparency in election funding, reduces corruption risks, and builds public trust by making all transactions verifiable and immutable.
